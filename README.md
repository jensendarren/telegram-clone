# VueJS Telegram Clone App

SO Question reference [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46898262/how-to-receive-my-own-telegram-messages-in-node-js-without-bot).

### MTProto Libary Dependency Fix

This project requires forked [telegram-mtproto](https://github.com/jensendarren/telegram-mtproto) library to exist in the same parent directory as this project.

Cloe that repo and now in the `telegram-mtproto` directory run `npm install`

Return to this application and continue to develop, build and run the project as normal.

### Testing the application using the Telegram Data Center test servers

This application connects to the test Telegram Data Center (dc) so use the phone number `+9996620000` and code `22222` when trying this out!
